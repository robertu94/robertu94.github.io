Traditional losslesscompression, however, does not provide adequate compression of floating point data often found inscientific codes. Recently, researchers and scientists have turned to lossy compression techniquesthat approximate the original data rather than reproduce it in order to achieve desired levels ofcompression. Typical lossy compressors do not bound the errors introduced into the data, leading to the development of error bounded lossy compressors (EBLC). These tools provide the desired levelsof compression as mathematical guarantees on the errors introduced. The current state of EBLCleaves much to be desired. The existing EBLC all have different interfaces requiring codes to bechanged to adopt new techniques; EBLC have many more configuration options than theirpredecessors, making them more difficult to use; and EBLC typically bound quantities like pointwise errors rather than higher level metrics such as spectra, p-values, or test statistics thatscientists typically use. My dissertation aims to provide a uniform interface to compression and todevelop tools to allow application scientists to understand and apply EBLC. This canvas presentsthree groups of work: LibPressio, a standard interface for compression and analysis;FRaZ/LibPressio-Opt frameworks for the automated configuration of compressors using LibPressio;and work on tools for analyzing errors in particular domains</description></item><item><title>Lossy Compression for AI</title><link>http://robertu94.github.io/presentations/jlesc2020-lossy.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://robertu94.github.io/presentations/jlesc2020-lossy.html</guid><description>As time progresses, the volume of data surrounding machine learning and AI methods continues to grow from training, testing, and validation datasets to the models themselves. As the volume grows, there are increasing challenges in transporting and storing the data. Lossy compression techniques present the opportunity to drastically reduce the volume of data while maintaining or even improving upon the quality of the decisions made by AI. This talk presents a survey of novel research examining the effect of lossy compression on AI decision making in a variety of domains including medical data science and physics. We examine the effects of data ordering, error bounds, compression methodologies to make general recommendations from these and other areas regarding how to effectively leverage lossy compression in AI using the common LibPressio interface.</description></item><item><title>FRaZ: A Generic High-Fidelity Fixed-Ratio Lossy Compression Framework for Floating Point Scientific Data</title><link>http://robertu94.github.io/presentations/ipdps2020-fraz.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://robertu94.github.io/presentations/ipdps2020-fraz.html</guid><description>With ever-increasing volumes of scientific floating-point data being produced by high-performance computingapplications, significantly reducing scientific floating-point datasize is critical, and error-controlled lossy compressors have beendeveloped for years. None of the existing scientific floating-pointlossy data compressors, however, support effective fixed-ratiolossy compression. Yet fixed-ratio lossy compression for scientificfloating-point data not only compresses to the requested ratio butalso respects a user-specified error bound with higher fidelity. Inthis paper, we present FRaZ: a generic fixed-ratio lossy com-pression framework respecting user-specified error constraints.The contribution is twofold. (1) We develop an efficient iterativeapproach to accurately determine the appropriate error settingsfor different lossy compressors based on target compressionratios. (2) We perform a thorough performance and accuracyevaluation for our proposed fixed-ratio compression frameworkwith multiple state-of-the-art error-controlled lossy compressors,using several real-world scientific floating-point datasets fromdifferent domains. Experiments show that FRaZ effectively iden-tifies the optimum error setting in the entire error setting space ofany given lossy compressor. While fixed-ratio lossy compressionis slower than fixed-error compression, it provides an importantnew lossy compression technique for users of very large scientificfloating-point datasets.</description></item><item><title>LibPressio Tutorial</title><link>http://robertu94.github.io/presentations/libpressio2020-tutorial.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://robertu94.github.io/presentations/libpressio2020-tutorial.html</guid><description>This video provides a basic tutorial of how to install and use LibPressio &amp;ndash; a generic abstraction for lossless and lossy compression for dense tensors.

However, using error bounded lossy compression can be challenging. There is a proliferation of interfaces, different semantics, and difficult to understand relationships to user error bounds. This talk presents two tools — LibPressio and FRaZ — that help address these issues. LibPressio provides a usable abstraction across SZ, ZFP, MGARD, as well as traditional image compressors (JPEG, WEBP, PNG, TIFF, etc) and lossless compressors via BLOSC. FRaZ is a tool that uses LibPresssio to compress datasets according to a Fixed Compression Ratio with progress towards supporting arbitrary user error bounds. I present our recent work submitted to IPDPS and current work in progress.</description></item><item><title>Predicting Optimal Error-Bounded-Lossy-Compression Configuration</title><link>http://robertu94.github.io/presentations/sc2018-predicting.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://robertu94.github.io/presentations/sc2018-predicting.html</guid><description>Techniques for predicting error bounded lossy compression ratios from data distribution and compressor settings.</description></item><item><title>C++ Templates: Starring into the Abyss</title><link>http://robertu94.github.io/presentations/templates.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://robertu94.github.io/presentations/templates.html</guid><description>C++ templates are one of the most powerful, and probably least understood aspects of C++ programming. Trying to understand error messages from templates code can feel like staring into the abyss. In this talk, I introduce many of the various features and dive into applications of C++ templates that are used in the wild. I will cover several of the common pitfalls and design patterns that result from this feature of C++. I will also stare right into the heart of the abyss and explain why the error messages can be cryptic, why its a good thing, and how to begin to decipher those error messages.</description></item><item><title>Dockerize All the Things!</title><link>http://robertu94.github.io/presentations/docker.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://robertu94.github.io/presentations/docker.html</guid><description>This talk introduces Docker and why you should care about it.

It is hard to read, harder to understand, and harder still to debug and change. In this talk, I introduce the discipline of refactoring which transforms code in a way that maintains its external behavior while improving it&amp;rsquo;s internal structure. I will present several examples of poor design often seen in imperative code, and describe some techniques to refactor this code to easier to understand semantic code from Martin Fowler&amp;rsquo;s book &amp;ldquo;Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Software&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Automation in the Classroom</title><link>http://robertu94.github.io/presentations/autograding.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://robertu94.github.io/presentations/autograding.html</guid><description>The purpose of this talk is to introduce how instructors could approach the topic of using automation in the classroom. We will make a case for automation both from a student&amp;rsquo;s and instructor&amp;rsquo;s perspective by showing that automation can save time, encourage test driven development, and improve testing for knowledge. We will also address concerns regarding grading automation including accuracy, confidentiality, and security. Then we will get into detail about techniques and tools that can be used for classroom automation. Finally we will examine case studies of how automation has and can be implemented. We will examine how this has been done technically as well as part of the classroom environment by faculty members at the School of Computing.</description></item><item><title>Exploitable 2</title><link>http://robertu94.github.io/presentations/exploitable_2.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://robertu94.github.io/presentations/exploitable_2.html</guid><description>This talk introduces Docker and why you should care about it.
