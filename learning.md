# Learning to Learn

Learning is a life long process, and learning computer science is no different.  This set of articles serve to be an overview to some of the areas of academics and life that I get the most questions about. Think of them as something between a frequently asked questions and an introduction to a topic.

What order should I tackle these? The articles are grouped by topic, so you can start reading through them according to the topics you are interested in.  However, if you have no idea of where to start, consider reading the articles in "Meta" first.  These articles will better equip you to read and get something out of the other articles

Lastly, if you find the articles insufficient in some way, please [email me](mailto:rr.underwood94@gmail.com"), and I'll try to make updates to fill out the missing information

## Meta 

+ [Reading]({% link learning/reading.markdown %}): how to get the most out of technical documents
+ [Studying]({% link learning/litrature-review.markdown %}): how to go about learning new topics
+ [Intake]({% link learning/intake.markdown %}): how to stay up to date on current topics
+ [Writing]({% link learning/writing.markdown %}): how to summarize topics for others to learn

## Process

+ [Experiments]({% link learning/experiments.markdown %}) how to write empirical computer science experiments

## Programming Languages

+ [C++]({% link learning/cpp.markdown %}) how to learn C++, a low-level systems language that helps you get the most out of your hardware
+ [Python]({% link learning/python.markdown %}) how to learn Python, a high-level programming language aimed at developer productivity
