I am a PhD Candidate at Clemson University studying Computer Science.

My particular **research interests** are lossy compression, distributed systems, and operating systems.
I am currently working with the [Data Intensive Computing Environments (DICE) Lab][dice] and [Fault Tolerant HPC Lab (FTHPC)][fthpc] studying error bounded lossy compression under my adviors Dr. Amy Apon, Dr. Jon C. Calhoun, and Dr. Franck Cappello.

Academics
---------

You can find my full CV [here][cv].

My **publications** can be found on my Google Scholar page [here][googlescholar].

While at pursuing my PhD:

+ (Ongoing) I developed [LibPressio][libpressio] a library to abstract the differences between lossless and lossy compressors and their configurations.
+ (2019) I was selected for the [US Department of Energy Office of Science Graduate Student Research Program][scgsr] award to study at [Argonne National Laboratory][argonne] under Dr. Franck Cappello.
+ (2018) I taught a Fall section of [Introduction to Operating Systems (CPSC 3220)][cpsc3220].
+ (2017 - 2020) I was awarded the [National Research Traineeship in Resilient Infrastructure and Environmental Systems fellowship][ries].

In Undergrad, I was the Vice President of the [Clemson Chapter][clemsonacm] of the Association for Computing Machinery.
I was competed in our programming team as well as with [CU Cyber][cucyber] -- our cyber security team.  

Experience
----------

I have worked on a variety of different projects both personal and professional.
Professionally, I have interned for Unitrends and Boeing in software development roles.
Most of my projects are in C, C++, or Python.
I served as the principal author for the [Clemson ACM Programming Team][acm-hp] and the [CUCyber][cyber-hp] Hackpacks.
These documents are tools for competing in ACM algorithm and security competitions respectfully.
I also have developed a series of presentations on a variety of computer science topics.


Outside Computer Science
------------------------

I am a Christian.
I am an Eagle Scout.
I enjoy spending time outdoors; I especially enjoy biking and backpacking.
I also enjoy playing strategic board games with friends.
