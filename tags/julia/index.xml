It&amp;rsquo;s been a few years
since I first used Julia in 2019, and it hasn&amp;rsquo;t completely replaced Python for
me. However, I wanted to share a few neat projects that I&amp;rsquo;ve done using it
which would have been much more painful without it, and share what I think now
about what I wrote in 2019.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Julia: Could There be One Language?</title><link>https://robertu94.github.io/posts/2019-03-21-julia-could-there-be-one/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2019 09:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://robertu94.github.io/posts/2019-03-21-julia-could-there-be-one/</guid><description>&lt;p>There is a constant problem with programming language design: fast, generic, easy to write; pick two.
The principle is that programming languages cannot be all three at once.
Code that is Fast and Generic like C++ isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly easy to write.
Code that is Generic and easy to write like Python isn&amp;rsquo;t always fast in the sense that C/C++ programmers mean it.
Code that is Fast and Easy to Write isn&amp;rsquo;t always Generic in the sense that Python is.
There is a new language on the block &amp;ndash; Julia &amp;ndash; which strives to challenge these assumptions.
In the remainder of this post, I highlight what I like about it and describe my experience using it over the last semester.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
