Doing good science is difficult. It requires discipline and attention to detail. However there are strategies that can help you focus on answering the questions you can attempt to answer. First you should ask, “is this a scientific question?” Not all questions are scientific questions. Questions about aesthetics, values, ethics are not science questions. “Is A better than B?” is not a scientific question, it’s a question of values. Questions of values require trade offs, and while important can’t be solved with the scientific method of stating assumptions, posing questions, designing experiments, collecting data, and interpreting results. “Can method A achieve more flops than method B in a given specific context?” Is more of a scientific question.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
