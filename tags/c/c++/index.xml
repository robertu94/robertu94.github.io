It supports at least 4 programming paradigms (procedural, functional, object-oriented, template meta-programming).
In some senses, many languages give you one great way to do things: C++ gives you every way and trusts you to use them well.
With this flexibility comes problems that C++ seems to have beyond what other languages experience.
Therefore, having effective tooling to develop and use C++ is essential.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Interpreters Made Easy</title><link>https://robertu94.github.io/posts/2017-01-15-interpretors-made-easy/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2017 10:14:14 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://robertu94.github.io/posts/2017-01-15-interpretors-made-easy/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Interpreter pattern from the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">&amp;ldquo;Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object Oriented Software&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> can potentially be a very powerful pattern.
It allows you to use a domain specific language to represent a complex computational situation.
However, writing interpreters in practice can be tricky and time consuming.
It really helps to know something about some fundamental parsing algorithms and techniques.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
