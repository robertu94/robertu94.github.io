Its syntax is concise, expressive, and elegant. Unlike other tools in its category, it has excellent documentation with working examples and intuitive naming. Learning it use it effectively can help you be a more productive developer.
Speeding Up Ansible Anyone that has used ansible for more than a few hosts with more than a few tasks knows that by default it can be really slow.</description></item><item><title>Poor Man's Parallelism</title><link>http://robertu94.github.io/2017/01/08/poor-mans-parallelism.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jan 2017 10:58:14 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://robertu94.github.io/2017/01/08/poor-mans-parallelism.html</guid><description>I really like orchestration tools such as Ansible or SaltStack. They can make running tasks on a group of machines a breeze. But sometimes you can&amp;rsquo;t or don&amp;rsquo;t want to install these tools on a machine. In cases like these, it is helpful to know how to parallelize some tasks in the shell.
You can do this via Unix/shell job control:
cmd=&amp;#34;systemctl enable --now docker.service&amp;#34; hosts=(host{1..4}) for host in ${hosts[@]} do ssh &amp;amp; $host $cmd done However from experience, this can be very error prone.</description></item></channel></rss>
