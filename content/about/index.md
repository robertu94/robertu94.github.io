I am an Assistant Computer Scientist at Argonne National Laboratory under Franck Cappello.
My particular **research interests** are lossy compression, science data and evaluation for AI, distributed systems, and systems programming.

Some specific topics I have worked on include: AI for Science focusing on identifying, leveraging, and evaluating the semantic content of scientific datasets. Lossy compression for scientific data with an interest in interface design, optimization to preserve user qualities of interest, accelerator implementations, the use of compilers in compression pipelines, prediction and modeling of compression ratio performance. Data management including novel uses of checkpointing and lineages of data states beyond fault recovery to accelerate computation as applied to AI inference, model training, and other areas.

You can find my full CV [here][cv].

I completed a postdoc at Argonne National Laboratory in October 2024 focusing on AI, lossy compression, and data management.
I earned my PhD at Clemson University studying Computer Science in December 2021.
I am previously worked with the [Data Intensive Computing Environments (DICE) Lab][dice] and [Fault Tolerant HPC Lab (FTHPC)][fthpc] studying error bounded lossy compression under my adviors Dr. Amy Apon, Dr. Jon C. Calhoun, and Dr. Franck Cappello.

My **publications** can be found on my Google Scholar page [here][googlescholar].

Some highlights of my career include:

+ (2024-Ongoing) I accepted a position as Assistant Computer Scientist at Argonne National Laboratory
+ (2024-Ongoing) I am the co-Lead for the Data team in AuroraGPT. Argonne's effort to develop a LLM specialized for scientific use cases
+ (2019-Ongoing) I developed [LibPressio][libpressio] a library to abstract the differences between lossless and lossy compressors and their configurations.
+ (2023) I was awarded an Laboratory Directed Research and Development grant along with Viktor Niktin on the topic of streaming lossy compression for tomographic data.
+ (2022) I started a postdoctoral position at Argonne National Laboratory under Franck Cappello, Sheng Di, and Bogdan Nicolae
+ (2019) I was selected for the [US Department of Energy Office of Science Graduate Student Research Program][scgsr] award to study at [Argonne National Laboratory][argonne] under Dr. Franck Cappello.
+ (2018) I taught a Fall section of [Introduction to Operating Systems (CPSC 3220)][cpsc3220].
+ (2017 - 2020) I was awarded the [National Research Traineeship in Resilient Infrastructure and Environmental Systems fellowship][ries].

In Undergrad, I was the Vice President of the [Clemson Chapter][clemsonacm] of the Association for Computing Machinery.
I was competed in our programming team as well as with [CU Cyber][cucyber] -- our cyber security team.  



Outside Computer Science
------------------------

I am a Christian.
I am an Eagle Scout.
I enjoy spending time outdoors; I especially enjoy biking and backpacking.
I also enjoy playing strategic board games with friends.
