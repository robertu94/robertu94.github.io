# Learning to Learn

Learning is a life long process, and learning computer science is no different.  This set of articles serve to be an overview to some of the areas of academics and life that I get the most questions about. Think of them as something between a frequently asked questions and an introduction to a topic.

What order should I tackle these? The articles are grouped by topic, so you can start reading through them according to the topics you are interested in.  However, if you have no idea of where to start, consider reading the articles in "Meta" first.  These articles will better equip you to read and get something out of the other articles

Along the way you will find activities added to each post formatted like this:

+ This is an activity designed to help you master the content in this section

Lastly, if you find the articles insufficient in some way, please [email me](mailto:rr.underwood94@gmail.com), and I'll try to make updates to fill out the missing information
