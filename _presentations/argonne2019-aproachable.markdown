  Error Bounded Lossy Compression is a powerful technique that combines the power of lossy compression with the strong guarantees for the preservation of the original data. However, using error bounded lossy compression can be challenging. There is a proliferation of interfaces, different semantics, and difficult to understand relationships to user error bounds. This talk presents two tools — LibPressio and FRaZ — that help address these issues. LibPressio provides a usable abstraction across SZ, ZFP, MGARD, as well as traditional image compressors (JPEG, WEBP, PNG, TIFF, etc) and lossless compressors via BLOSC. FRaZ is a tool that uses LibPresssio to compress datasets according to a Fixed Compression Ratio with progress towards supporting arbitrary user error bounds. I present our recent work submitted to IPDPS and current work in progress.
